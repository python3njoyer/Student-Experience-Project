# Survey_analysis

This project was built to retrieve written responses from an online survey and analyze and visualize the most frequently used words in order to identify common themes. The survey served to measure what university students missed most from in-person courses following the switch to remote learning in March 2020. As such, common words included: environment, interaction, campus, discussion, and person.

The first script, SurveyAnalysis.py, includes basic Natural Language Processing methods for data cleaning. After data cleaning, the words are written to a text file for visualization. This text file is then used as input for the accompanying script, which displays a word cloud based on the text file.

For confidentiality purposes, the original spreadsheet from the project is not uploaded; however, the word list used for the word cloud is included as cleaned.txt.
